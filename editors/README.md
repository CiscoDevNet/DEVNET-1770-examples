In pyCharm:
- Open the json-parse-example.py
- Click on Run > Run 'json-parse-example.py'
- Observe the console output

- Let's look at integrated debugging
- Set a breakpoint on line 4
- Click on Run > Debug 'json-parse-example.py'
- Hover over the variables, look down below at the debugger

- Click on the debugger controls to step in or over the function

In Atom:
- Open the json-parse-example.py
- Note that there isn't a Run option
- Instead, you need to open a terminal window to execute your code.
- Also note that there isn't a debug option either.

In vsCode:
- Similar to Atom in many ways, but is more like a lightweight IDE
- It includes code completion, debugging, linting, and so on.
- You'll notice a Debug option
- If you're doing NodeJS programming, this may be a good option as it has very good JS debugging.
