The "norris" project demonstrates how to do basic testing and mocking of an API call using the Chuck Norris Joke API.

To run this project:

Prerequisites: You need to have python3.6 and pip3 installed.

1) Create a virtualenv: in the norris directory, virtualenv venv --python=python3.6
2) source venv/bin/activate
3) pip3 install tox
4) (Optional if using PyCharm) 'pip3 install requests nose'.  Also, right click the norris/ directory and Mark as... "Sources Root"

To execute the tests:
Option 1) tox
Option 2) python3 setup.py test

When you're all done, you can switch off the virtual environment with "deactivate"


Virtual environments
- In Python, a very useful tool is called virtualenv.
- Virtualenv creates a directory in which your python versions and dependencies are stored.
- Prevents caching issues
- Commands:
    virtualenv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    deactivate

Tox
- A test runner utility that also leverages virtual environments
- Look at tox.ini

Mocking

Open norris/norris/tests/test_norris.py

Change Line 37 to:

        mock_get.return_value = test_response
